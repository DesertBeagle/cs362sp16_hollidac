Line occurence: 861
Function: cardEffect
Part of the function: the Tribute card effect

The for loop goes through each card in the next player's discard 
pile and puts it into the next player's discard pile. The for loop
goes from the first element to the last, but as it is doing so
it lowers its upper limit. Any of the cards that are past the
upper limit are lost, and now the next player's discard is
filled with -1's.

The fix:
Remove line 861, then add

state->discardCount[nextPlayer] = 0;

after the for loop.
