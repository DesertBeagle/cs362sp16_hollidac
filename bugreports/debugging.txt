The first step I took to finding bugs in my code is run testdominion
the random tester on my code. After playing around with different
seeds, I came upon an infinite loop. Of course, this filled up the 
screen with text, so I couldn't actually find what the problem
was by scrolling up. I redirected the output to a file and anylized
the output. I found that what caused the infinite loop when one of
the players plays a feast card.

This method definitely fell under the "check the plug"
principle, as it was simply looking to find the loop inside the 
tribute card effect and seeing what was wrong. Essentially, if
the input went to any of the error handling if statements,
it would just iterate through the loop again without
changing the variable inside the conditional statement.
This was a simple fix, as I changed that variable, then
to communicate to my tester, I had the function return that
variable. The random tester finds the big bugs, which is nice
for the game breaking bugs, but for the smaller, more intricate
bugs, it is much harder to use.
