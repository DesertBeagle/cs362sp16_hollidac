I immediately ran into a difference on my first run. The difference
happens on line 13469, and the only difference is the card bought
and the card played. It is not apparent who is correct from the 
difference file. It is especially hard, because the differences
are slight. They deal with the implementations of each card,
so you would have to comb through the logs carefully to see where the 
implementations differ. This is why differential testing is not ideal,
because it takes a lot of time analyzing logs to determine the problem.
Also, either or both of our implementations are wrong, so it doesn't
really help to see who is actually correct in their implementation.

The coverage of the two dominions are:
